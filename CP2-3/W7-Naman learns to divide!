/*********************************************
Naman's friends just taught him division and he wants to show off his dividing skill. His friends give him a list of integers and challenge him to find the longest dividing sequence in the list (i.e. where each integer divides the next completely). Help Naman find the longest dividing sequence.

Input Format

The first line contains N, the number of integers Naman's friends give him.
The second line has N integers of the type 1 <= Ai <= 1e9, where the ith integer represents the ith integer given to Naman.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 2000
1 <= Ai <= 1e9
Output Format

Output contains a single line, the length of the maximum dividing sequence.
Sample Input 0

9
2 3 7 8 14 39 145 76 320
Sample Output 0

3
Explanation 0

It has a dividing sequence of length 3, namely {2,8,320} (8 mod 2 = 0 and 320 mod 8 = 0), but none of length 4 or greater.
