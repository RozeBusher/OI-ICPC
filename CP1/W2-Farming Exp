/******************************************
Kirito is playing a game called Sword Art Online. He wants to level up faster, so he arrives at a dungeon where all the monsters can be killed in one hit, which is suitable for exp farming. Each type of monster respawns once a while, allowing him to keep killing them and gaining the experience points. Given a list of monster spawning rules, and assume Kirito kills a monster immediately when it spawns, can you predict how Kiritoâ€™s kill log looks like?

Input Format

The first part of the input contains only one line, the number of spawning rules N.

The second part of the input is a list of spawning rules, in the following format:

Monster [Monster ID] [Respawn Interval] 
For example:

Monster 35 15
Monster 37 40
Monster 38 2
The final part of the input contains only one line, the number of kill entries K you should output.

Constraints
N<=1000
Monster ID>=1
Respawn Interval<=3000
K<=500000

Output Format

You should output in the following format:

Killed [Monster ID]

of the first K kills by Kirito, one kill entry per line. If more than one monster spawns at the same time, Kirito kills them in the ascending order of their IDs.

Sample Input 0
2
Monster 61 200
Monster 203 300
5

Sample Output 0
Killed 61
Killed 203
Killed 61
Killed 61
Killed 203
