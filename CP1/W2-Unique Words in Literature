As Zach's lucky number is 2, he wants to figure out the second appeared unique word in the book.

Note: A unique word only appears once in the book.

Input Format

The first line of Input contains an integer N, indicates the number of words in the book, followed by one line with N words separated by spaces.

Note there might be punctuation in the book, and you need to ignore them. For example you should read "I'm" as "Im" and "it." as " it"

Constraints
N <= 1e6

Output Format
Output the second unique word or -1 if it doesn't exist.
